Ignition controller for VW air cooled engines.

Volkswagen air cooled engines have been produced over 70 years and millions of them still in use today pushing beetles, buses and even small aircraft. Such engines cheap and easy to maintain yet their outdated design provides space for a lot of hacking. 

The present project addresses a small but important improvement in the engine by the control of coil charging time and providing constant time for burning the fuel mixture allover the engine RPM range.
